can you list some of the one D two D element three D element and tell their corresponding element stiffness matrix size
Yes, here are some commonly used elements in Finite Element Analysis and their corresponding element stiffness matrix size:

1D elements:

Truss element: 2x2
Beam element: 3x3
Rod element: 2x2
2D elements:

Quadrilateral element: 4x4
Triangle element: 3x3
3D elements:

Hexahedron element: 8x8
Tetrahedron element: 6x6
Wedge element: 6x6
Note that the size of the element stiffness matrix depends on the number of degrees of freedom for each element and the type of element used. The element stiffness matrix is used in assembling the global stiffness matrix for the whole structure.

ok tell me for a 3d element in finite element analysis is the element stiffness matrix 8 cross 8 or 6 cross 6 like  a tetrahedron element
The size of the element stiffness matrix for a 3D element in finite element analysis depends on the type of element used. For a tetrahedron element, the element stiffness matrix is usually 6x6. However, for other types of 3D elements such as brick or hexahedron elements, the element stiffness matrix can be 8x8 or larger, depending on the number of degrees of freedom considered for the element.

tell me the most famous ones used by these companies Some popular finite element software packages include: ANSYS, Abaqus, ABAQUS, LS-DYNA, and COMSOL. and their type and applications and the dimension of matrix they use list them all
ANSYS: ANSYS is a widely used finite element software package that provides simulation solutions for various industries such as aerospace, automotive, and construction. It can be used to simulate various physical phenomena including thermal, mechanical, fluid, and electromagnetic. ANSYS supports 1D, 2D, and 3D elements and the size of the element stiffness matrix depends on the dimension of the element being used.

Abaqus: Abaqus is another popular finite element software package used in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, and biomedical. It supports both linear and nonlinear simulations and can be used to simulate a wide range of physical phenomena including mechanics, thermal, and fluid mechanics. Abaqus supports 1D, 2D, and 3D elements and the size of the element stiffness matrix depends on the dimension of the element being used.

LS-DYNA: LS-DYNA is a simulation software package widely used in the automotive industry for simulating crash, impact, and dynamic events. It supports both explicit and implicit dynamic simulations and can be used for 1D, 2D, and 3D element simulations. The size of the element stiffness matrix depends on the dimension of the element being used.

COMSOL: COMSOL is a multiphysics simulation software package widely used in various industries such as electrical, mechanical, and biomedical engineering. It supports both linear and nonlinear simulations and can be used to simulate a wide range of physical phenomena including thermal, fluid, and electromagnetic. COMSOL supports 1D, 2D, and 3D elements and the size of the element stiffness matrix depends on the dimension of the element being used.

Note: The size of the element stiffness matrix is dependent on the dimension of the element being used. For example, a 2D element such as a triangle or quadrilateral will have a 6x6 or 8x8 element stiffness matrix, while a 3D element such as a tetrahedron or hexahedron will have a 12x12 or 20x20 element stiffness matrix.

ok what is the maximum size used in these software and some advanced researches 
The size of the finite element stiffness matrix can vary widely depending on the problem being solved and the size of the system being modeled. For commercial software packages like ANSYS, Abaqus, LS-DYNA, and COMSOL, the size of the stiffness matrix can range from a few hundred to tens of thousands of elements.

In advanced research, the size of the stiffness matrix can be much larger, sometimes in the millions or even billions of elements, for very complex models with large numbers of degrees of freedom.

It's worth noting that the size of the matrix is not the only factor in determining the computational efficiency of a finite element analysis, as various algorithmic and software optimization techniques can be applied to reduce the computational cost and improve performance.
